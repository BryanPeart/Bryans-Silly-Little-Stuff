# FoundryVTT Module

Just some items I use in my games. if anyone finds this your welcome to use it. Everything is very jank and there is very little structure or organization. Just whatever works when I needed it. 

## Changelog
- Added the first blood hunter items for a friends game. they all use DAE and Item Macro, but no midi cause I wanted to keep it light on automation.
